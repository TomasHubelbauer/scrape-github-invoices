## Move downloaded invoices to a given directory

`a href` indicates the file name so we can move the files once all downloads complete.

## Consider implementing OTP with the GitHub seed to be able to derive 2FA code myself

If successful, this can be made fully automatic.

## Follow along with the headless download issue

[The headless download GitHub issue](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues/299)

This combined with automatic 2FA might make this usable as a `cron` job.
